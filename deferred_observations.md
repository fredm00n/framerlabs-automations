# Deferred observations

Observations logged by the self-improvement loop that did not meet the
Step 2b triage criteria (3+ recurrences or data loss). If the same issue
appears across multiple sessions it will cross the recurrence threshold
and be implemented.

---

- **2026-05-25** — Reddit RSS 500 outage (2026-05-18): 25/43 subreddit feeds
  returned HTTP 500 in a single run. All errors came from a single Reddit-side
  outage; the existing partial-failure alerting and retry logic handled it
  correctly. No data loss (leads re-appear in subsequent RSS fetches). Single
  occurrence — does not meet the recurrence threshold.

- **2026-05-27** — reddit_leads.py routes Notion PATCH/GET calls through the
  Reddit-specific SSL-bypass wrapper (ssl.CERT_NONE). _Resolved 2026-05-28:_
  the local `http_get`/`http_patch` wrappers now pick the SSL context per host
  (`_ssl_context_for`), applying the cert bypass only to `reddit.com` URLs so
  Notion calls keep default TLS verification. See deferred_improvements.md.

- **2026-06-03** — Self-improvement review found no production failures: the
  committed `logs/errors.jsonl` is empty. The only error entries visible in this
  VM's working tree were locally-generated sandbox artifacts (43 × HTTP 403
  "Blocked by egress policy" — the observe-only VM's own egress restriction, not
  a Reddit/production failure) and were discarded. Both parsers and the lead
  filter look healthy; full test suite passes (369 tests). No change warranted.

- **2026-06-09** — Self-improvement review found no production failures: the
  committed `logs/errors.jsonl` is still empty. The working tree again showed
  only sandbox artifacts (45 × HTTP 403 "Blocked by egress policy" from a single
  observe-only startup run spanning 07:07–07:08, plus a matching
  `state/alert_state-reddit_leads.json` bump) — discarded. Both parsers
  syntax-check OK and the full test suite passes. No change warranted.

- **2026-06-11** — Self-improvement review found no production failures: the
  committed `logs/errors.jsonl` is empty. No errors in the 7-day window, so no
  log trimming was needed. Both parsers syntax-check OK and the full test suite
  passes (369 tests). The lead filter and category inference look healthy. No
  broken parser, no recurring data-losing failure, and no substantive
  filter/subreddit/category improvement evidenced this session. No change
  warranted.

- **2026-06-18** — Self-improvement review: `logs/errors.jsonl` contains 1785
  entries in the 7-day window. The framer_templates parser logged 5 RSC
  parse failures on June 16-17 (spanning ~12 hours), all resolving
  automatically — the RSC endpoint returned 0 templates for those runs but
  recovered without any code change; the candidate-key diagnostic correctly
  identified `"resource":` as present during those hours, indicating a
  temporary Framer deployment issue rather than a structural format change.
  The script is working correctly now (12 templates parsed in today's run).
  The remaining 1780 entries are reddit_leads HTTP 429s (rate-limiting from
  Reddit's RSS endpoint) — the existing retry, early-abort, and Retry-After
  logic is handling these correctly. No data-losing failure and no code fix
  warranted. Full test suite passes (373 tests). No change warranted.
