# Deferred observations

Observations logged by the self-improvement loop that did not meet the
Step 2b triage criteria (3+ recurrences or data loss). If the same issue
appears across multiple sessions it will cross the recurrence threshold
and be implemented.

- **2026-05-25** — Reddit RSS 500 outage (2026-05-18): 25/43 subreddit feeds
  returned HTTP 500 in a single run. All errors came from a single Reddit-side
  outage; the existing partial-failure alerting and retry logic handled it
  correctly. No data loss (leads re-appear in subsequent RSS fetches). Single
  occurrence — does not meet the recurrence threshold.

- **2026-05-27** — reddit_leads.py routes Notion PATCH/GET calls through the
  Reddit-specific SSL-bypass wrapper (ssl.CERT_NONE). _Resolved 2026-05-28:_
  the local `http_get`/`http_patch` wrappers now pick the SSL context per host
  (`_ssl_context_for`), applying the cert bypass only to `reddit.com` URLs so
  Notion calls keep default TLS verification. See deferred_improvements.md.
